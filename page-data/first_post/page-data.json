I‚Äôm also known as afrokilla#8343 on Discord and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/afrokilla\">@afrokilla</a> on Twitter. Yes, I‚Äôm that guy who spams giveaways and comments, but I also post about up-and-coming NFT projects (sometimes). Anyway, I work as a programmer with a degree in computer science engineering and after my day job I spend most of my time on Discord servers grinding for those whitelists and minting/trading NFTs.</p>\n<h3>Why I started this blog</h3>\n<p>I had been thinking of starting a blog for a while now, initially it would be more related to programming and feature tutorials and stuff, but I recently amassed a huge Twitter following of <strong>103 people</strong> with my crypto account and felt I cannot disappoint my loyal followers.</p>\n<p>I feel there is much gatekeeping in the space, especially for people new to NFTs &#x26; crypto. For myself it was also difficult to get started, hard to find new projects, to get whitelisted, to know if a project was good or not. Luckily, by random chance, I met some great guys in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RetroWolvesNFT\">RetroWolves</a> discord voice chat. One thing led to another and we made or own ‚ÄúAlpha Discord‚Äù to discuss projects, share alpha, and crack some jokes.</p>\n<p>I have learned much more from our small community than I would have ever learned on my own in the same timeframe.
